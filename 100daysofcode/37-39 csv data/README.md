# Goal: Predict the menu items at an (American) Thanksgiving meal for a random region in the US.

# Data set: Thanksgiving 2015

Implementation: Write a program that

1. loads the corresponding CSV file.
2. Asks the user for their US Region (give them a choice between available regions in the data set)
3. Ask for their income range (also in this data set)
4. Output a "region appropriate" menu of 5 items
